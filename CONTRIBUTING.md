# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
This repo is the source code for a static site, written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Markdown.
Instead of installing the framework, I set up the repo to run in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

What you'll want to do:

Option 1: Make your change inside of Gitpod and preview the changes
