# HOWTO blog
Hugo blog template for Hacktoberfest HOWTO. The goal of this site is to be a collaborative guide to participating in open source, espeically during the month of October, when Hacktoberfest provides additional incentives to new developers.

This site uses the [Hugo Terminal Theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) and uses a GitHub Action to auto-deploy the site to GitHub pages, at [hacktoberfesthowto.github.io](https://hacktoberfesthowto.github.io/)


# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
This repo is the source code for a static site, written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Markdown.
Instead of installing the framework, I set up the repo to run in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).
